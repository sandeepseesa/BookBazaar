## Project Overview

This project is a **Bookstore** web application where users can register, log in, browse books, and perform CRUD operations such as creating, editing, and deleting books. The authentication is handled using **JWT tokens** and **Google OAuth** for seamless login, and the application is designed to be responsive for both desktop and mobile views.

## Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure authentication with access and refresh tokens.
- **Google Login Integration**: Users can log in with their Google accounts.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for both mobile and desktop views.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete operations for books.
- **Protected Routes**: Only authenticated users can access specific routes.
- **Token Expiry Handling**: Token expiry managed using `Axios` interceptors.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean and modern design with Tailwind CSS and React Icons.
- **Navigation Bar**: A responsive and dynamically updating Navbar.
  
## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Axios, Tailwind CSS, React Icons
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (Free shared MongoDB instance used)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens), Google OAuth, Passport.js
- **Deployment**: [Render](https://render.com/), GitHub

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bookstore-mern.git
   cd bookstore-mern
   ```

2. Install the dependencies for both frontend and backend:
    ```bash
    # Install backend dependencies
    cd backend
    npm install

    # Install frontend dependencies
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```
    
## Environment Variables 

  Create a .env file in the backend directory and set the following environment variables:
  
  ```bash
  PORT=3000
  MONGO_URI=your-mongo-uri
  JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
  SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
  GOOGLE_clientID=your-google-client-id
  GOOGLE_clientSecret=your-google-client-secret
  GOOGLE_callbackURL=http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback
  ```

  ## Usage

  To start the project, use the following commands:

  1. Start the backend server:

     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm start
     ```
  2. Start the frontend development server:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start
    ```

  Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to explore the bookstore!

  ## Authentication

  - JWT Authentication: The user is authenticated via JWT tokens stored in cookies. The httpOnly option is used to ensure     that cookies are not accessible via JavaScript, adding a layer of security.
  - Google OAuth: You can log in using your Google account. On successful login, the system generates a JWT token.

  ## Responsive Design

  - The Navbar and CRUD operations are designed to be responsive. On mobile views, the navbar includes a sliding menu that opens from the right side.
  - Buttons, forms, and inputs are optimized for smaller screens to ensure smooth navigation and ease of use.

  ## Error Handling

  - Token expiration is handled using Axios Interceptors in the frontend. When a token expires, the user is alerted, and they are navigated to the login page.
  - The server sends meaningful error messages in the event of authentication or authorization issues.

  ## Token Expiry Handling
  
  If the JWT token expires before the cookie, it will cause failed authentication attempts. You can adjust expiration times by:

  - Setting the JWT token and cookie expiration times to be consistent.
  - Implementing token refresh mechanisms for a better user experience.
  
  ## Security Measures
  
  - httpOnly Cookies: The JWT token is stored in cookies with the httpOnly flag, preventing client-side JavaScript access.
  - Environment Variables: Sensitive keys such as JWT secret, Google client IDs, and MongoDB URIs are stored in environment variables.
  - Token Expiration: The token expiry is handled to force re-authentication and protect the app from unauthorized access.
  - CORS: Proper CORS configuration is applied to allow only trusted domains.
